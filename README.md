# README Generator

## Description

This project is a README generator that allows the user to create high-quality README by simply answering a few questions. This is the first time I have used node.js and the first project that I have created that works solely in the terminal rather than the browser. I struggled the most with making a functioning table of contents.

While I didn't work directly with anyone on this project, my cohort group helped answer many of my questions. I really enjoy the collaborative nature of this program.  I also received help from a tutor. I also used the following sites for help and suggestions.
